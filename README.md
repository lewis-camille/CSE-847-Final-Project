# CSE 847 Final Project
Camille Lewis

## Instructions
Extract the training images compressed file `train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz` (the raw file `train-images.idx3-ubyte` was too large to upload).
Run `main.m`. All files in repository are needed for the main program to run.

## Dependencies
The Deep Learning Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB in order to run this project.

## Sources
`loadMNISTImages.m` and `loadMNISTLabels.m` were taken from the free-to-(non-commercially)-use source code from

D. Stutz. **Introduction to Neural Networks.** Seminar Report, Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition Group, RWTH Aachen University, 2014.
